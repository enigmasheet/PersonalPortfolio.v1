    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

    <p class="about-description">
        I am a dedicated <strong>Web Developer</strong> with a strong foundation in modern application development using <strong>Blazor</strong>, <strong>.NET</strong>, and <strong>cloud technologies</strong>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from <strong>Texas College of Management and IT, Sifal, Kathmandu</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
        My journey into software development stems from a deep-rooted interest in technology and a passion for solving meaningful, real-world problems. Over the years, I have developed and contributed to applications that are scalable, maintainable, and user-centric.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
        In addition to my technical background, I bring experience in <strong>software product management</strong>, where I collaborate with cross-functional teams to lead the planning, development, and delivery of software products. This dual perspective strengthens my ability to align technical implementation with strategic business goals.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
        Outside of work, I enjoy activities that challenge my creativity and focus — including <strong>robot combat competitions</strong>, <strong>competitive gaming</strong>, and <strong>swimming</strong>. These hobbies contribute to my problem-solving mindset and help me stay balanced and motivated.
